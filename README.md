# Healthy Smoothies App 
###### Part of Data Applications Builder Workshop - Snowflake Learning Community Member!!!

### Integrated Snowflake's cloud data platform into a hands-on setting with this Streamlit app for ordering healthy smoothies. 

- As part of the project, I successfully built and deployed a Streamlit app that featured dynamic UI entry forms for seamless data collection. 
- Utilized Python to efficiently insert and retrieve data from Snowflake tables, ensuring robust database management. 
- Additionally, I set up and maintained the codebase on GitHub, enabling streamlined collaboration and version control. 
- The project also involved making REST API calls to collect external data, strengthening my skills in API integration and backend development. 
- This experience deepened my proficiency in end-to-end app development, data handling, and cloud database integration.
